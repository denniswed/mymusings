# Current State of things

The White House release is [National Secuirty Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf) a couple days ago.

Let's set aside the fascism and isolationist parrellels, even if alarming.

What bothers me is it speaks to promoting healthy families, especially children, and then competence based merit. It bothers me because the current administration's activities seem to contradict this.

We have seen this with the HHS continually disregarding actual experts and scientists when making new policy instead listening to influencers and coporations. This is not competence based. When did disregarding the scientific method become NOT competent?

Both parties (Democrat and Republican) play a role in where we are it right now. People got but hurt about DEI policies and rhetoric and instead of trying to take the time to understand, explain and address concerns, it was just forced down. This made for great fear based rhetoric that spammed the american public making people think it was bad. To be fair, some DEI policies were not well thought out, some of it was. Like everything else, you are supposed to see how things work then adjust as new information comes available. 

Additionally, we have allowed corporations and super wealthy ideals drive a lot of the narrative. It is almost a conspiracy worthy discussion, to be honest. Keeping the wealth in a small percent of the public, with the way we currently allow for a free for all of money in campaign finance, allows that wealth to drive the narrative and direction for this country.

To stop this we have to start pushing towards true campaign finance reform. We should not be allowing unabated money into the conversation. Despite what people think about freedom of speech and all that, we should be controlling how much is allowed to be spent for political races. Focus on substance of the political message not the rhetoric and fear mongering.

This can only happen though if we can get everyone on the same page. The vast majority of americans probably feel defeated and don't think they could change anything. This works great for those already in power and with the wealth. But change has to happen, or we are going to head towards a real internal conflict between the people. This type of wealth disparity does not have very good endings, if history is to teach us anything.
