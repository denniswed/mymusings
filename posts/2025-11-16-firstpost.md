# Welcome to My Musings

These blogs exist to allow me to just put my thoughts into the void so they stop keeping me awake at night.

I may add more, I may not.

For a first post, I am just trying to see if my stupid site even works. Yes I use AI Co-pilot to help me build it. Welcome to reality. All code is copied from somewhere.

For those of us who can't keep all the syntext straight of the 10 different languages I have to deal with, Co-Pilot (or things like Amazon Q) are a huge helper.

That being said, if you don't understand what AI made for you, then stop and understand what it is doing. READ THE CODE! Every line! Why, because AI, despite it's name, is nothing but algorithmic pattern building based off data on the internet.

Anyone who assumes it is perfect and safe is a moron.
